Hi All,
My name is Solomon, I love data and am finishing up my MSDS at Utica.
This Readme file is part of my Introduction to GitHub lesson. I just created a repository, which is my default master branch and then I had to create a branch(a copy of master) to make my changes. If someone makes changes to the master while I am working on my branch I will need to pull in the changes to synchronyize the changes. Saved changes in my branch are called commits. Super Cool stuff!--
This repository is an introduction to Github class exercise for DSC 611
